# __Pizza Picker__

#### __An application which a user can use to choose one or more individual toppings (cheese, pepperoni, artichoke, anchovy, etc) and a size to order a pizza and see the final cost., August 28, 2020__

#### By _**Emme Buentiempo**_

## Description

This application was created as an Epicodus assignment, with the intent to have it serve as a demonstration of knowledge after the program's fourth week. For the time being this README will serve as a checklist to demonstrate the satisfaction of all project requirements and objectives.

## Project requirements:

  * Create a website for a pizza company where a user can choose one or more individual toppings (cheese, pepperoni, artichoke, anchovy, etc) and a size to order a pizza and see the final cost. **[Incomplete]**

  * Allow the user to choose toppings and size for the pizza they'd like to order. **[Incomplete]**
  * Create a pizza object constructor with properties for toppings and size. **[Incomplete]**
  * Create a prototype method for the cost of a pizza depending on the selections chosen. Use your own formula for this. **[Incomplete]**
  * Keep it simple to start! You do not need to have a complex formula for determining cost (although you can if you like). The most important part of this code review is using and demonstrating your understanding of constructors and prototypes. **[Incomplete]**

## Project Objectives:

  * Code meets standards from previous weeks. **[Incomplete]**
  * Constructors and prototypes are used successfully. **[Incomplete]**
  * Application works as expected. **[Incomplete]**
  * Plain English specs are included in your README. **[Incomplete]**
  * Required functionality is in place by the 5:00pm Friday deadline. **[Incomplete]**
  * Project is in a polished, portfolio-quality state. **[Incomplete]**
  * Project demonstrates an understanding of this week's concepts. If prompted, you can discuss your code with an instructor using correct terminology. **[Incomplete]**

  _For reference, here are last week's standards:_

  * Project is in a presentable, portfolio-quality state. **[Incomplete]**
  * Code is clean, well-refactored, and easy-to-read. This includes correct indendation, spacing, and including only necessary comments and debugging tools. **[Incomplete]**
  * Variable names are descriptive and use lower camel case (e.g. myVariableExample). **[Incomplete]**
  * JavaScript business logic and user interface logic are separate. **[Incomplete]**
  * Tests are included for each behavior and code is committed after each test passes. **[Incomplete]**
  * Commits are made regularly with clear messages that finish the phrase "It willâ€¦". **[Incomplete]**
  * Project README that includes, bare minimum:
    * author name **[Incomplete]**
    * program name **[Incomplete]**
    * detailed setup instructions **[Incomplete]**
    * description **[Incomplete]**
    * copyright and license information **[Incomplete]**

## Specs for Program Behaviors

  1.[X] Take input from user for toppings and size via form, and when submitted, create an object for the pizza created using the input from the form.
    * Input: *Red Sauce* *Cheese* *Medium*
    * Output: *pizza1.toppings = ["redSauce", "cheese"]
    * Output: *pizza1.size = "medium"

* _type "cd desktop", then press enter_
* _type "git clone https://github.com/3emme/pizza-picker", then press enter_
* _locate and open folder on desktop named "pizza-picker"_
